# 🎯 IoT-Based Environmental Monitoring System with AR Visualization

## 🚀 Overview
Created an environmental monitoring system that tracks atmospheric conditions and presents the data using Augmented Reality (AR) for enhanced visualization.

## 🤝 Contributors
- **Dipankar Bagade**

## ✨ Features
- 📡 **Real-Time Environmental Data**: Monitors temperature, humidity, and air quality.  
- 👓 **AR Data Visualization**: Displays real-time sensor data in AR.  
- 📡 **Remote Monitoring**: Cloud-based data access using Blynk IoT.  

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements
- 🎛️ **STM32 Microcontroller**
- 🌡️ **SHT31-DIS Sensor** (Temperature & Humidity)
- 🔋 **Power Supply**

## 🖥️ Software Stack
- ⚡ **VS Code (C++)**
- 📡 **Blynk IoT (Cloud Integration)**
- 📱 **UnityHub (AR Visualization)**

## 🎮 How It Works
1. Sensors collect environmental data (temperature, humidity, air quality).  
2. Data is transmitted to the **Blynk IoT cloud**.  
3. Users can view **real-time sensor data** in an **Augmented Reality (AR) interface** for enhanced visualization.
