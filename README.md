✨ Features
🌡️ Real-Time Environmental Data: Monitors temperature, humidity, and air quality.
🕶️ AR Data Visualization: Displays real-time sensor data in AR.
📡 Remote Monitoring: Cloud-based data access using Blynk IoT.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements
🖲️ STM32 Microcontroller
🌡️ SHT31-DIS Sensor (Temperature & Humidity)
🔋 Power Supply

🧑‍💻 Software Stack
🛠️ VS Code (C++)
☁️ Blynk IoT (Cloud Integration)
🖥️ Java (AR Visualization)

🎮 How It Works

Sensors collect environmental data (temperature, humidity).

Data is transmitted to the Blynk IoT cloud.

Users access real-time data via a mobile app.

AR visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of data trends.
